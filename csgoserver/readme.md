# setup a csgo online server:

### download steamCMD

download the steamCMD with the following link
```
http://media.steampowered.com/installer/steamcmd.zip
```

### Setting UP the steamCMD

Put the steamCMD in a folder (trust me, you have to do this), because it will donwload a lot of files.

```
login anonymous
force_install_dir csgoserver
app_update 740 validate
```
wait the download, it will take a time

### Setting UP the server config

If you need to update your server, just open your steamCMD and type the following code.

```
app_update 740

```

donwload the server.cfg file, and make changes where is #.
